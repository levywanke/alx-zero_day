This directory contains files and directories created as part of the ALX SE Foundations project on Git.

## Directories and Files

- **bash/**: Contains Bash scripts.
  - `alx`: Bash script that prints "ALX School".
  - `school`: Bash script that prints "The school is open!".
  - `98`: Empty file created in branch `update_script`.

- **c/**: Contains C programming language files.
  - `c_is_fun.c`: Placeholder for C code.

- **js/**: Contains JavaScript files.
  - `main.js`: Placeholder for main JavaScript code.
  - `index.js`: Placeholder for index JavaScript code.

- **README.md**: This file, describing the contents of the `0x03-git` directory.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Repo-session**: Created the `0x03-git` directory and ensured a non-empty `README.md` was present.
   
2. **Coding fury road**: Created Bash, C, and JavaScript directories and populated them with the specified files.
   - Bash scripts (`alx`, `school`).
   - C file (`c_is_fun.c`).
   - JavaScript files (`main.js`, `index.js`).

3. **Collaboration is the base of a company**: Created and worked on the `update_script` branch.
   - Modified `bash/alx` and `bash/school` in the `update_script` branch.
   - Merged changes into `main` branch with a "Hot fix".

4. **Collaboration: be up to date**: Updated `README.md` on GitHub.com and pulled changes locally.
   - Created `up_to_date` file with the command used to update `README.md`.

5. **HAAA what did you do???**: Resolved conflicts when merging `update_script` branch into `main`.
   
6. **Never push too much**: Created `.gitignore` file to ignore Emacs ~ files.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout these tasks, I've learned fundamental Git operations including repository creation, branching, committing, pushing, pulling updates, handling merge conflicts, and using `.gitignore`.
